Turn your WeChat into an auto-reply bot powered by ChatGPT!

![Your Chat Bot in Group Chat!](doc/img/demo.png)

## Acknowledgement & Features <!-- omit in toc -->

This project is implemented based on [this amazing project](https://github.com/fuergaosi233/wechat-chatgpt) and [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty) SDK, but with a major adjustment: using the official OpenAI `API Key` to replace the previous pesudo-browser method, so it has the following features:

- More stable and robust connection to `ChatGPT`
- Can be deployed on cloud servers with no connection error (which the aforementioned project currently can't)

## 1. How to Deploy this Bot?

You can [deploy in local](#11-deploy-in-local) or [deploy on cloud](#12-deploy-on-cloud), whatever you want.

### 1.1 Deploy in Local

#### 1.1.1 Configure Environment Variables

You can copy the template `config.yaml.example` into a new file `config.yaml`, and paste the configurations:

```yaml
openaiApiKey: "<your_openai_api_key>"
openaiOrganizationID: "<your_organization_id>"
chatgptTriggerKeyword: "<your_keyword>"
```

**Please note**:

- `openaiApiKey` can be generated in the [**API Keys Page** in your OpenAI account](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- `openaiOrganizationID` is optional, which can be found in the [**Settings Page** in your Open AI account](https://beta.openai.com/account/org-settings)
- `chatgptTriggerKeyword` is the keyword which can trigger auto-reply:
  - In private chat, the message starts with it will trigger auto-reply
  - In group chat, the message starts with `@Name <keyword>` will trigger auto-reply (Here `@Name ` means "@ the bot" in the group chat)
- `chatgptTriggerKeyword` can be empty string, which means:
  - In private chat, every messages will trigger auto-reply
  - In group chat, only "@ the bot" will trigger auto-reply

Or you can export the environment variables listed in `.env.sample` to your system, which is a more encouraged method to keep your `OpenAI API Key` safe:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_KEY="org-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export CHATGPT_TRIGGER_KEYWORD="Hi bot:"
```

---

#### 1.1.2 Setup the Docker

1. Setup Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t chatgpt-on-wechat .
```

2. Setup Docker Container

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml chatgpt-on-wechat
```

---

### 1.2 Deploy on Cloud

Click the button below to fork this repo and deploy with Railway!

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/zKIfYk?referralCode=D6wD0x)

**Please note:**

Make sure the environment variables are set in RailWay instead of writing directly in `config.yaml`. It's really **NOT** recommended to implicitly write out your `OpenAI API Key` in public repo. Anyone with your key can get access to the OpenAI ChatGPT API services, and it's possbile for you to lose money if you pay for that.

## 2. How to Link to your WeChat?

Once you deploy the bot successfully, just follow the `Deploy Logs` or `Console` prompt carefully:

1. Scan the QR Code with mobile WeChat
2. Click "Accpet" to allow desktop login (where our bot stays)
3. Wait a few seconds and start chatting!

ü§ñ **Enjoy your powerful chat bot!** ü§ñ

## 3. Any Fancy Advanced Settings?

### 3.1 Config `ChatGPT` Models

You can change whatever `ChatGPT` Models you like to handle task at different capability & time-consumption trade-off. (e.g. model with better capability costs more time to respond)

Currently, we use the latest `text-davinci-003` model, which is:

> Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. Also supports inserting completions within text.

Also, for the same model, we can configure dozens of parameter. (e.g. answer randomness, maximum word limit...)

You can configure all of them in `src/chatgpt.js`:

```typescript
const ChatGPTModelConfig = {
  // this model field is required
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  // add your ChatGPT model parameters below
  temperature: 0.9,
  max_tokens: 2000,
};
```

For more details, please refer to [OpenAI Models Doc](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

---

### 3.2 Config `ChatGPT` Features

You can change whatever `ChatGPT` features you like to handle different types of tasks. (e.g. complete text, edit text, generate image...)

Currently, we use `createCompletion()` to generate or manipulate text for daily usage, which:

> Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters

You can configure in `src/chatgpt.js`:

```typescript
const response = await this.OpenAI.createCompletion({
  ...ChatGPTModelConfig,
  prompt: inputMessage,
});
```

Of course you can ask how to edit text in current mode, but the outcome may fall short of expectations.

For more details, please refer to [OpenAI API Doc](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

---

### 3.3 Config Auto Reply in Error

When `ChatGPT` encounters some errors (e.g. over-crowded traffic, no authorization, ...), the chat bot will auto-reply the pre-configured message.

You can change it in `src/chatgpt.js`:

```typescript
const chatgptErrorMessage = "ü§ñÔ∏èÔºöÈ∫¶Êâ£ÁöÑÊú∫Âô®‰∫∫ÊëÜÁÉÇ‰∫ÜÔºåËØ∑Á®çÂêéÂÜçËØïÔΩû";
```

---

### 3.4 Add Customized Task Handler

You can add your own task handlers to expand the ability of this chat bot!

Currently, add task handler in `src/main.ts`:

```typescript
// e.g. if a message starts with "Hello", the bot sends "World!"
if (message.text().startsWith("Hello")) {
  await message.say("World!");
  return;
}
```

Of course, stuffing all handlers in `main` function is really a **BAD** habit in coding. As a result, we will fix this in future updates to do logic separation.

## 4. How to Contribute to this Project?

You can raise some issues, fork this repo, commit your code, submit pull request, and after code review, we can merge your patch. I'm really looking forward to develop more interesting features!
